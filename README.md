# The impact of lifestyles across the U.S. under hyperinflation

##By Zixuan Pan

## Story Pitch Summary
The United States is facing the most severe inflation in 40 years due to multiple factors, such as the implementation of massive stimulus measures, rebounding demand, and poor supply chain after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic. Different income groups in the United States face a mismatch between income growth and consumption growth simultaneously, forcing many people to change their lifestyles.

This data analysis report will reveal how people's lives are affected by analyzing consumer index breakdowns and income growth levels. By exploring different data, we will demonstrate how people's life patterns have been impacted since the Covid-19 pandemic.

A recent joint survey by George Mason University's School of Policy and Government and The Washington Post revealed that nearly 90 percent of respondents have begun purchasing cheaper goods, and about three-quarters have reduced spending on dining out and entertainment or postponed scheduled purchases.

The survey conducted by CBS News polling shows that rising prices are making many Americans worry about economic turn to negative expectations and being unable to afford their retirement, vacations, and even daily expenses. One-third of the respondents said they were "very concerned" about their ability to pay for goods and services to meet their basic needs.
